        <h3> Nato Thompson: Culture as a Weapon at Strand Bookstore </h3> 
   
        <h4> January 20: 5:30PM – 7:00PM </h4> 
        <p> In Culture as Weapon: The Art of Influence in Everyday Life, activist, curator, and critic Nato Thompson asks us to see the culture wars as more than just Reagan-era history, but as part of an evolving assault that uses art and affect to appeal to our emotional selves. In a sweeping account, he connects the innovative public relations strategies developed in the early 20th-century by Edward Bernays, Ivy Lee, and others to modern-day phenomena as diverse as urban development, public art, charitable giving, and even the U.S. military?s battle for “hearts and minds” in the Middle East. </p>

        <h3> Josh Barkan: Mexico at Strand Bookstore </h3>
 
        <h4> January 23: 7:00PM – 8:00PM </h4> 
        <p> The unforgettable characters in Josh Barkan’s astonishing and beautiful story collection Mexico—chef, architect, nurse, high school teacher, painter, beauty queen, classical bass player, plastic surgeon, businessman, mime—are simply trying to lead their lives and steer clear of violence. A teacher struggles to protect lovestruck students whose forbidden romance has put them in mortal peril. A painter’s freewheeling ways land him in the back of a kidnapper’s car. Again and again, the walls between “ordinary life” and cartel violence are shown to be paper thin, and when they collapse the consequences are life-changing.</p>
